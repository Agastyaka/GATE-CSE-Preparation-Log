#  Day 28 – GATE CSE Preparation

### Date
15 January 2026

---

## 📘 Subject
Discrete Mathematics

---



## 📚 Topics Studied
- Free variables in first-order logic
- Bounded (bound) variables in first-order logic

---



## ❌ Confusions
- Identifying whether a variable is free or bounded
- Scope of quantifiers in complex formulas

---

## 🧠 Key Points Learned
- A variable is bounded if it is within the scope of a quantifier
- Variables not under any quantifier are free
- Understanding variable scope is essential for correct interpretation


---

## 🎯 Plan for Day 29
- Quantifier scope and nesting
- More practice on free vs bounded variables
